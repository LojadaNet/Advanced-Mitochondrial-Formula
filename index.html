    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <h2>About the Advanced Mitochondrial Formula</h2>
    <p>
      Many people struggle with low energy and fatigue as they age. While coffee,
      energy drinks and teas may offer short-term stimulation, they do not address
      the root cause of fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cellular energy production plays a critical role in how your body functions.
      When energy levels decline inside your cells, performance and vitality may
      decline as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting mitochondrial health may help your cells produce energy more
      efficiently — contributing to overall well-being.

        <li><strong>Mitochondria are the power plants of your cells.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mitochondrial health is a key factor in healthy aging.</strong></li>

    <h2>NAD and Cellular Energy</h2>

    <p>
      NAD is an essential molecule involved in energy production. Every major
      system in your body relies on it — from brain and heart function to muscles
      and metabolism.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we age, NAD levels naturally decline, which may reduce cellular energy.
      This formula was designed to support NAD-related pathways.
